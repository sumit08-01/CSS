<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .test {
        color: green;
      }
      p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="test">Hello World!</p>
    <section>
      In this example, we have added a class selector (named "test"), and
      specified a green color for this class. The text will now be green (even
      though we have specified a red color for the element selector "p"). This
      is because the class selector is given higher priority:
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
